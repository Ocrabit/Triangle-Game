# Triangulink
This project was created for the BU-GD Game Jam themed around **triangles**.  
We took the theme literally and built a cute, small action-puzzle game where you **triangulate your enemies** across a set of levels.  
Each stage explores differing scenes and crowd movement where you need to capture the disguised target in the crowd.
