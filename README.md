# Triangulink

This project was created for a game jam themed around **triangles**.  
We took the theme literally and built a small action-puzzle game where you **triangulate your enemies** across a set of levels.  
Each stage explores a different twist on triangular connections to defeat targets and progress.

You can play the game here:
